# Debunk of DeepSeek R1 bouncing ball fail

The prompt :

Write a Python program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The ball should be affected by gravity and friction, and it must bounce off the rotating walls realistically. The ball must stay in the spinning hexagon.

This program features:
1. A spinning hexagon that rotates continuously
2. A ball affected by gravity (pulling downward) and friction (gradually slowing motion)
3. Realistic collision responses that account for:
   - The rotating walls' velocities
   - Coefficient of restitution (bounciness)
   - Proper collision normal calculations
4. Continuous collision detection to prevent the ball from escaping the hexagon

The ball will realistically bounce off the spinning walls while being affected by physics forces. The hexagon's rotation speed, gravity, friction, and bounce elasticity can all be adjusted using the constant values at the top of the script.
